## College Football Live Stats: NCAA Division 1

### Main Features
This android application will allow college football enthusiast to have updated information on all games.
Not everyone has access to tv networks that show the football games they want to watch so a much easier way is to get live 
game stats all on your mobile device. These statistics will be game times, tv channels, live updates, such as score, quarters, time, down marker, and possession.
There will be a list of all Division 1 college football teams and once you select a team you will be given an option for the schedule, or
live stats. Live stats wll only be available during a game period while the schedule will be available at all times.
The app will provide the needed information to stay up to date on your favorite college football team.

### Similar Applications, and Comparisons
There are applications already available on the google play store, such as [Sports Alert][4] and [Scores App][3]. Sports Alert sends important notifications
to you device so you are aware of anything someone may want to know about a given game. My application will not have notifications, but the
information on the notifications will be similar to what you can find and follow on my app. The Scores App will be very similar to my application,
where people follow games that they choose and get access to everything they could want to cover the game.
There are also websites available such as [Espn][1] and [Ncaa][2] that provide these same features but of course these are accessible on the web.
