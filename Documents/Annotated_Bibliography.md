<p> 1. <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/schedule">ESPN LINK</a>
   Espn is a website or an app for viewing all college games schedules, scores, and details of an upcoming game.
   They also provide a streaming service to watch these games. This will be similar to my app except mine will focus
   on college football primarily but mine will not have a streaming application for the games. The main focus is to
   have dates, scores, location or other information like weather and ticket prices that may be important for an upcoming game.</p>
