<p> 1. <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/schedule">ESPN LINK</a>
   Espn is a website or an app for viewing all college games schedules, scores, and details of an upcoming game.
   They also provide a streaming service to watch these games. This will be similar to my app except mine will focus
   on college football primarily but mine will not have a streaming application for the games. The main focus is to
   have dates, scores, location or other information like weather and ticket prices that may be important for an upcoming game.

<p> 2. <a href="https://www.ncaa.com/news/football/article/college-football-tv-schedule-game-times-preview">NCAA LINK</a>
    Ncaa website that has a list of every division 1 college football game and gives its time and tv cchannel to watch.
    You can also find a rankings list of the top 25 teams and also storylines for certain teams. 
    My app will be similar at listing all the teams in division 1 college football along with their date/time and the tv station they wil be playing on.

<p> 3. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sports.schedules.football.ncaa&gl=US">SCORES APP: COLLEGE FOOTBALL APP</a>
    This is an app on the google play store that provides live scores, notifications, updated stats, previews, tv channel, rankings, etc.
    This app will be very similar to the features my app will have which will not contain as much informaiton as the websites have but still enough to cover the games.
    The main focus is to allow someone to follow the games that may not have access to live video of the game.
