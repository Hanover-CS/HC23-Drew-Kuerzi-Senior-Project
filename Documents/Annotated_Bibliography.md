<p> 1. <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/schedule">ESPN LINK</a>
   Espn is a website or an app for viewing all college games schedules, scores, and details of an upcoming game.
   They also provide a streaming service to watch these games. This will be similar to my app except mine will focus
   on college football primarily but mine will not have a streaming application for the games. The main focus is to
   have dates, scores, location or other information like weather and ticket prices that may be important for an upcoming game.

<p> 2. <a href="https://www.ncaa.com/news/football/article/college-football-tv-schedule-game-times-preview">NCAA LINK</a>
    Ncaa website that has a list of every division 1 college football game and gives its time and tv channel to watch.
    You can also find a rankings list of the top 25 teams and also storylines for certain teams. 
    My app will be similar at listing all the teams in division 1 college football along with their date/time and the tv station they wil be playing on.

<p> 3. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sports.schedules.football.ncaa&gl=US">SCORES APP: COLLEGE FOOTBALL APP</a>
    This is an app on the google play store that provides live scores, notifications, updated stats, previews, tv channel, rankings, etc.
    This app will be very similar to the features my app will have which will not contain as much information as the websites have but still enough to cover the games.
    The main focus is to allow someone to follow the games that may not have access to live video of the game.
</p>

<p> 4. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lunosoftware.ncaafbscores">SPORTS ALERTS: NCAA FOOTBALL EDITION</a> 
    This is another app from the google play store that is mainly for fast live alerts for players and in game details.
    This app provides all the main details such as quarter changes, lead changes, updated score, close game alert, long distance pass or run plays, and more.
    There are also other features that allow you to keep track of schedules and other interesting stats around the teams.
    The app I am building will relate closely to this as it does not revolve closely to other sports like the websites mentioned before,
    but instead focuses on college football itself, and providing people with everything they need to follow their teams.
