## Competing applications

1.  [NFL Scores and Schedule 2022][1]
    This app has a main focus on providing a viewer with schedules of each team and the scores of their games. Along with this
    they provide a live score update every 30 seconds. The difference from my app is that mine will provide major stats of the game, while I also will have
    scores and schedules for each team.
 
2. [NFL Mobile][2]
   NFL Mobile provides almost everything you need to follow any game you are interested in, but it comes with a price.
   The live streaming services are not provided for free but the minute-by-minute scoring and stat updates are available with no cost.
   This app is primarily for following games as they are played while mine is for you to easily access a box score of any game for anyone who may
   not have the money or time to follow a live game or would like to recap on an existing game from before.

3. [ESPN LINK][3]
   Espn is a website or an app for viewing all levels of football and their game schedules, scores, details, and news headlines of an upcoming game.
   They do not provide a streaming service to watch NFL games, but they do for colleges. This will be similar to my app except mine will focus
   on NFL football primarily but mine will not have news headlines and live updates. The main focus for my app
   is to be able to retrieve a box score of any NFL game that has already been played.

4. [SPORTS ALERTS: NFL Edition][4] 
    This is another app from the google play store that is mainly for fast live alerts for players and in game details.
    This app provides all the main details such as quarter changes, lead changes, updated score, close game alert, long distance pass or run plays, and more.
    There are also other features that allow you to keep track of schedules and other interesting stats around the teams.
    My app will not have notifications of these live plays but all this will be accessible with the box score once the game has finished.
   
## API


## Programming Language
XML is the markup that will be used for the display and layout of viewable objects in the app while Java will be the programming language to control the behavior of those viewed objects.
Java language is an object oriented programming where functions revolve around the objects created.
For example XML will be used to get a button to appear on the screen and the button would be the object that Java functions will use to make something happen, such as move to the next page when the button is pressed.
